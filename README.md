# Clubmaster Booking Plugin

The **Clubmaster Booking Plugin** allows you to easily embed a booking flow into any website.
It connects to the [Clubmaster API](https://app.clubmaster.org/api/v3/doc) and can be customized to fit your brand and business needs.

A live demo of the plugin is available here:

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Standalone Booking Page

Every plugin comes with its own public booking URL.
You can use this URL directly without any integration:

```
https://app.clubmaster.org/public/booking/{id}/
```

Replace `{id}` with your plugin's unique ID.

---

### 2. Embedding the Plugin in Your Website

Add this script to your page, replacing `id` with your plugin ID:

```html
<script>
  window.BW_WIDGET_CONFIG = {
    id: 62, // Required
    name: "Variant 3", // Optional, for identifying widget variant
    attributes: { color: "RED" }, // Optional, for custom attributes
  };

  const script = document.createElement("script");
  script.src = "https://cdn.beastscan.com/plugin/booking/plugin.js";
  document.head.appendChild(script);
</script>
```

Add a container element where you want the booking widget to appear:

```html
<div id="bw-widget"></div>
```

**Note:**

* The widget will automatically render inside the `#bw-widget` container.
* The plugin will follow the container‚Äôs width.
  For responsiveness, use `max-width` instead of fixed `width`.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Plugin Behavior

The `window.BW_WIDGET_CONFIG` object allows you to customize how the plugin works.
You can set:

* **`id`** (required) ‚Äì The plugin ID from your CRM system.
* **`name`** (optional) ‚Äì A label for the plugin instance.
* **`attributes`** (optional) ‚Äì Key/value pairs for customization (e.g., colors, variants).

---

## üìä Tracking Events

You can track user interactions and send data to **Google Analytics**, **Google Tag Manager**, or any other analytics system.

### Example:

```js
window.BW_WIDGET_CONFIG = {
  id: 62,
  name: "Variant 3",
  attributes: { color: "RED" },

  trackEvents: {
    viewService: function () {
      return {
        plugin_name: "Hello",
      };
    },
    chooseService: function (summary) {
      return {
        friendly_name: summary.service.friendly_name,
      };
    },
    chooseLocation: function (summary) {
      return {
        created_at: summary.location.created_at,
        postcode: summary.location.postcode,
      };
    },
  },
};
```

**Notes:**

* Each `choose` event automatically sends `id` and `name` to analytics.
* The `summary` object contains additional data that you can map to custom analytics fields.

## üì¶ Accessing the Booking Object

You can execute custom logic when a booking is confirmed by using the `onConfirm` callback:

```js
window.BW_WIDGET_CONFIG = {
  id: 62,
  name: "Variant 3",
  attributes: { color: "RED" },

  onConfirm(booking) {
    console.log("Booking confirmed:", booking);
    // You can send booking data to your CRM, analytics, or other systems here
  },
};
```
